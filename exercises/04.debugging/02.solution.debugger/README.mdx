# Debugger

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/react-component-testing-with-vitest/debugging-tests/debugger/solution" />

Using the debugger allows me to step through my test wherever and whenever I need to. However, it would be really helpful to pause after my test marks a cell in the `<TicTacToe />` component. I can do that by placing a `debugger` statement after the corresponding actions in the test:

```tsx filename=tic-tac-toe.browser.test.tsx nonumber nocopy highlight=5,8,11
test('places cross marks in a horizontal line', async () => {
	render(<TicTacToe />)

	await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'left middle' }).click()
	debugger

	await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'middle', exact: true }).click()
	debugger

	await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'right middle' }).click()
	debugger

	const squares = page.getByRole('button').elements().slice(3, 6)
	expect(squares.map((element) => element.textContent)).toEqual(['✗', '✗', '✗'])
})
```

Running this test via the "Debug Vitest Browser" will now stop the test execution at the `render(<TicTacToe />)` step automatically. I can jump to my own breakpoint by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> or the `⏵` button in the debugging controls.

Every `debugger` statement _creates a breakpoint_. Once the JavaScript engine reaches that breakpoint, its execution will pause until it's resumed. I can inspect the DOM, styles, JavaScript execution, and the test state as if the time has froze now!

## `--inspect-brk` vs `--inspect`

One more noteworthy thing are the flags we are using to create a debugging process, specifically, the `--inspect-brk` flag.

You may provide both `--inspect` and `--inspect-brk` flags to Vitest, but they behave differently. `--inspect-brk` will make Vitest _automatically add a breakpoint before every `render()`_, while `--inspect` will not.

## What's next?

With debugging configured around our test suite, it's time to explore how you can get even more value out of your newly-found time stopping superpowers.

# Playwright

Problem: Using the default `preview` provider in Vitest is great to try things out, but it relies on Chromium being installed on your system (and also isn't that powerful). To have a proper setup, and be able to run it in CI, we need to define an explicit provider. Let's use Playwright.

---

Let's start by installing `playwright`:

```sh nonumber
npm i -D playwright
```

Playwright needs browser executables to be present on your machine to run. In this workshop, I am using Chromium as my browser of choice, so I can install just that particular browser by running the following command:

```sh nonumber
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

> 🦉 You can provide the Playwright CLI with a specific browser you want to be installed. This reduces its footprint in the system by fetching only the browsers you need.

The next step is to tell Vitest to use Playwright as the browser provider for component tests. In `vite.config.ts`, set the `test.browser.provider` option to `'playwright'`:

```ts filename=vite.config.ts add=11
/// <reference types="vitest" />
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [react()],
	test: {
		globals: true,
		browser: {
			enabled: true,
			provider: 'playwright',
			instances: [
				{
					browser: 'chromium',
				},
			],
		},
	},
})
```

And, finally, let's update the type definitions for the assertion matchers to be those from Playwright in `tsconfig.test.json`:

```json filename=tsconfig.test.json remove=9 add=10
{
	"extends": "./tsconfig.base.json",
	"include": ["vite.config.ts", "**/*.test.ts*"],
	"compilerOptions": {
		"target": "esnext",
		"module": "preserve",
		"types": [
			"vitest/globals",
			"@vitest/browser/matchers",
			"@vitest/browser/providers/playwright"
		]
	}
}
```

This will make sure that the locators, user events, and matchers are correctly typed.

Hooray! You've completed the journey through the realm of the component testing 👏👏👏.

There is so much value to be had from your React component tests. And now, you can finally have it all. Both the ergonomic, familiar API that Vitest provides and the reliability of the actual browser environment under the hood.

I cannot wait to see the tests you will write now!

# Page navigation

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/react-component-testing-with-vitest/best-practices/page-navigation" />

Components in your application don't exist in a vacuum. They are likely a part of a larger component tree that make up a page that lives at a certain _route_. Whether you are building a Single Page Application, or a Multi-Page Application, or even a Statically Generated Site, you are unlikely to avoid routing.

What interests us from the testing perspective here is that components can _access router data_ and _navigate to other routes_. We have to account for both of these use cases for reliable and resilient tests.

While you were gone, I've added some routing to our application with React Router. The `<DiscountCodeForm />` now belongs to a certain route and contains a link to a cart page.

If you try running the tests now via `npm test`, you will be faced with the following error:

```
Cannot destructure property 'basename' of 'React10.useContext(...)' as it is null.
  ❯ LinkWithRef /node_modules/.vite/deps/react-router.js:8171:11
```

This is a bit cryptic, but the stack trace here strongly suggests that the `<Link />` component is trying to read some context that is not available. In actuality, links cannot be rendered outside of the `<Router />` component, which we don't have in our tests.

We've said previously that component-level testing doesn't involve rendering the entire component tree, so the `<Router>` rendered within `<App />` is missing.

👨‍💼 In this exercise, you will solve this problem and restore order to the automated tests by creating a _custom wrapper_ for rendering our `<DiscountCodeForm />` component in tests. Follow the instructions in <InlineFile file="./src/discount-code-form.browser.test.tsx">`discount-code-form.browser.test.tsx`</InlineFile> to adjust the test setup and get the tests passing again.

👨‍💼 Once that's done, complete the newly added test case for the "Back to cart" link.

See you once you're done!

# User events

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/react-component-testing-with-vitest/best-practices/user-events" />

How your tests interact with UI elements is just as important as how they locate them. Your users don't dispatch events or programmatically access elements — they hover, click, type, and drag using their input devices.

So, how can we replicate real user interactions in our tests? Historically, integration testing relied on _simulating_ user events, mainly because Node.js can't actually interact with UI elements.

**But your component tests aren't running in Node.js anymore**. Being in the real browser also means using real user events. Actually hovering, clicking, typing, or dragging. One more benefit to reap from testing the code where it's supposed to run.

👨‍💼 This exercise has the following task for you: complete the automated test at <InlineFile file="./src/discount-code-form.browser.test.tsx">`discount-code-form.browser.test.tsx`</InlineFile> to enter a discount code, submit it, and verify it appears correctly in the UI.

Give it your best shot and see you in the solution to this exercise!

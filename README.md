## Prerequisites

You don't have to have any prior experience with Vitest or Vitest Broweser Mode
to complete this workshop.

- **A basic experience with TypeScript is required.**
- **A basic experience with component-level testing is beneficial.** This
  workshop works best if you've written component tests in the past. But don't
  worry if you haven't, you will write a bunch of those during the workshop!
- Get familiar with
  [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/),
  especially its
  [Guiding Principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles). You
  don't need to have any prior experience of using the library.

## Pre-workshop Resources

Here are some resources you can read before taking the workshop to get you up to
speed on some of the tools and concepts we'll be covering:

- [**Why I Won't Use JSDOM**](https://www.epicweb.dev/why-i-won-t-use-jsdom)
- [The Golden Rule of Assertion](https://www.epicweb.dev/the-golden-rule-of-assertions)
- [True Purpose of Testing](https://www.epicweb.dev/the-true-purpose-of-testing)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.18 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v18 or greater
- [npm][npm] v8 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

This is a pretty large project (it's actually many apps in one) so it can take
several minutes to get everything set up the first time. Please have a strong
network connection before running the setup and grab a snack.

> **Warning**: This repo is _very_ large. Make sure you have a good internet
> connection before you start the setup process. The instructions below use
> `--depth` to limit the amount you download, but if you have a slow connection,
> or you pay for bandwidth, you may want to find a place with a better
> connection.

Follow these steps to get this set up:

```sh nonumber
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/epicweb-dev/react-component-testing-with-vitest.git
cd react-component-testing-with-vitest
npm run setup
```

If you experience errors here, please open [an issue][issue] with as many
details as you can offer.
